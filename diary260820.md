# Diary Entry #1 | 26.08.2020

Today was the first day of our Database class. Therefore we first started with a quick introduction to the subject itself. Now I am familiar with the fact that databases are inalienble in nowadays digital world. Their purpose is to store data and adapt changes within the data in live time. Authorized users are able to edit the stored data when needed. It is a secure spot to save data and implement it in your program, websites etc..

We also talked about Codd's nine rules concerning databases. __By the way those are pretty important for the test!.__
Furthermore we discussed how to structure databases before we actually start the setting up process. Some important terms are entity, attributes and relationships. We organized them by using the Chen technique. We did this by scribbling ugly mind-map like relation trees. Attributes can be primary keys. Primary keys are static and do not change (f.e. SVN). We used this knowledge by applying it to different exercices. 

However, I'll stop this diary entry for today becaus my brain hurts and I need a rest.

Lots of kisses to robert. Your robert.
