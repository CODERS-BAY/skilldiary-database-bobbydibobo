Dear Diary,

I caught up the input I've been missing last wednesday. I learnd how to start phpmyadmin by using xampp. I created some empty tables and messed around with them. We learned different commands, f.e. to insert values intu our columns. Now I also know how to alter already existing tables. Using selectors in SQL is very handy, since the syntax is very similar to spoken english. Also "not" is "not" but not "!" or smth. I luv it. Database is my fav class from now on. 

I am looking forward to eat some delicious lasagna later. You might ask WHERE to go to get a piece too. It's actually made by my gf. She has the recipe FROM her mother. Basically you just need to SELECT the right ingredients and put it in the oven BETWEEN 40 AND 50 minutes
