# Diary Entry #2 | 02.09.2020

First we went through our homework an presented it on the whiteboard. We learned how to structure a ERM to make it visually obvoius what we are going for. Building bridges for example. 

Furthermore we discussed the 9 Codd rules again. Rules:

1. integration: uniform, non redundant data management (right data when apply)
2. operation: save, delete, change, insert
3. catalogue: access to data dictionary
4. user interface: different views for each user (rights)
5. integrity assurance: uniform, non redundant data management (right data when change while already applied)
6. access control: exclude not verified access
7. transaction: more database operation as a functional unit
8. synchronisation: parallel transaction (coordinate more users)
9. data security: restoration of data after some system error

We also learned how to resolve n/m relations to 1/n relations.
