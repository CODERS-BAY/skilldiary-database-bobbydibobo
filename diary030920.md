The main topic today was the normalization of data. It is mainly about avoiding redundance of data in order to avoid anomalies. We learned three forms of normalization so far.

Anomalies:

1. Update anomaly: f.e. if student adress changes, all concerned datas need a change
2. Insert anomaly: f.e. new students does not attend any class yet. However ClassID is a key, which needs to be filled.
3. Delete anomaly: f.e. if you delete last student of a class, Class name unknown.

Proves that functional relations between variables need to be paid attention to
