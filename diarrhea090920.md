# Diary Entry 4 | 09.09.2020

Dear diary,

today I did a couple of ERD exercises. It was a pleasure to have a day off of theory inputs. My stomach feels kinda bad today which resulted in some serius issues concerning my discharge area, but thats none of your business I guess.
However I am one step closer to understand database(schei√ü), which is nice. Sorry for my loose mouth but I accidentally was raging about databases while Stefan walked behind me. I felt like a dog when caught while eating his own shit. 
Ergo, it doesnt really bother me, since honesty is a very important attribute in every kind relationship.(Even student/teacher relations)

That's it for today, I need to go to a meeting now. It's about the consequences of opposing the gravitational forces to hold dark matter in place.
